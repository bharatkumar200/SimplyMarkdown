# SimplyMarkdown

A very simple way to handle Markdown content on your website

This package can be used to render the markdown content on your website. For example, you can write blog posts on your blog using markdown and parse it using SimplyMarkdown. It will return you the markdown content as html as well as the meta data on your markdown file tht you set, such as title, slug, description, etc.

The below example will illustrate.

## **Example 1: getting the contents of a markdown post**:

_sample-post.md_:

```md
---
title: This is a sample title
description: This is a description
cover_image: /path/to/image.png
slug: sample-post
---

This is the body content of the blog post.

```
